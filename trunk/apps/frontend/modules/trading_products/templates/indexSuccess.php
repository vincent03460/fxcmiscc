<h1>Forex (FX)</h1>
<p>The currency market is the largest and most active financial market, with an equivalent of over 4 trillion US Dollars
    traded every day. This is significantly larger than any other major financial market. As a result of high liquidity
    and the market’s unique decentralized characteristics, there are always price fluctuations in the Forex market. As a
    result of these price movements, there are always opportunities to make significant profits, even when other markets
    remain stagnant.</p>
<p>Trading in the currency market consists of two currencies (a cross or currency pair), in which one currency is bought
    (long) and the other is sold (short).</p>
<p><strong>Forex – Trading Conditions</strong></p>
